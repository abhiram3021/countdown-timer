Countdown Timer Web Application Documentation
________________________________________
Project Overview
The Countdown Timer Web Application allows users to set a target date and time and provides a live countdown in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until that moment is reached. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing the seamless integration of these technologies to create a functional and visually appealing application.

Workflow and Execution
1.	HTML Structure
The HTML file defines the core structure of the application, including:
o	A heading for the timer.
o	Input fields for the user to set a target date and time.
o	A "Start" button to initiate the countdown.
o	An area to display the remaining time dynamically.
2.	CSS Styling
CSS is used to style the application and enhance its visual appeal. Key elements like the timer display, buttons, and input fields are designed with responsive and user-friendly aesthetics. The application adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes to ensure accessibility.
3.	JavaScript Functionality
o	When the "Start" button is clicked, the script retrieves the user's input for the target date and time.
o	The difference between the current time and the target time is calculated and displayed in real-time using the setInterval() function.
o	The timer updates dynamically every second, showing the remaining time in the format: days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
o	When the countdown reaches zero, the timer stops, and a completion message is displayed.
4.	Optional Enhancements
Additional features can be implemented to enhance the user experience, such as:
o	Support for multiple timers on the same page.
o	Sound effects or animations when the countdown ends.
o	CSS animations to improve the timer's appearance and interactivity.
